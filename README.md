# python-challenge

This is my first Python data exploration! I am looking forward to working with the pandas library. This challenge would have been easier with it, but I learned quite a bit!


Two data sets are explored in this repository:

A budget analysis:
  The code here analyzes data about monthly profits to:
    -identify the total months of data
    -the overall profit
    -the changes between each month, including:
      -the average
      -the min
      -the max
    -display the results
    -save the results in a separate text file

Election results analysis:
  The code here analyzes data from an election to:
    -identify individual candidates
    -total the votes
    -calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate
    -determine a winner for the election
    -display the results
    -save the results in a separate text file
   Further slicing questions (to try later):
    -percentage of votes by county
    -population density for each county
